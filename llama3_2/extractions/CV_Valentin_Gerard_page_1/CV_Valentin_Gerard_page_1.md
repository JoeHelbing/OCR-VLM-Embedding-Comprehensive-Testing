**Experience**
--------------

### Institut FEMTO-ST, Computer Science Department

* June 2023 - September 2023
* Deep Learning Research Intern
	+ Designed and trained a model for automated detection of R-waves in highly noisy electrocardiograms (ECGs)
	+ Introduced artificial noise into the training dataset to evaluate the performance of our model using ECG data provided by Dijon Hospital
	+ Employed models designed to process ECG through time-frequency representation
	+ Leveraged a transformer model that combines information from both time and frequency representations

### National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA)

* September 2022 - June 2023
* Deep Learning Research Intern, Multispeech Team
	+ Designed and trained more efficient neural network architectures for audiovisual speech generative modeling using variational autoencoders
	+ Focused on encoding the input signal using both acoustic modality and visual modality
	+ Developed a decoder to reconstruct the input signal from the latent representation

### Lisi Automotive

* January 2022 - February 2022
* Factory Operator Intern
	+ Worked on automatic sorting machines for assembly solutions in the automotive industry
