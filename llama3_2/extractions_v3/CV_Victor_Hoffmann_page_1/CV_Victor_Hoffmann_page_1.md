**Seeking a PhD in Computer Vision**

**Experience**

* **Computer Vision Research Intern**
	+ SONY EUROPE (April 2024 - present)
	+ Schlieren, Switzerland
	+ Basic algorithm research with event-based vision sensor technology.
	+ Development and implementation of computer vision and sensor fusion algorithms on real-time platforms.
	+ Implementation of proof-of-concept demonstrators with novel cameras and devices from robotics area.
	+ Support establishment of R&D infrastructure which facilitates teamwork for research & development.
* **Deep Learning Research Intern**
	+ LORIA (Computer Science Research Laboratory) (June 2023 - August 2023)
	+ Nancy, France
	+ Led the first AI-based extraction of mechanical curves from fiber composites using only microstructure images, making the extraction 500 times faster while maintaining a 1% relative error.
	+ Created a multi-task computer vision model combining Equivariant CNNs and LSTMs.
	+ Collaborated with research teams at LEMTA (Physics Research Laboratory).
* **Machine Learning Research Intern**
	+ INRIA (Computer Science & Mathematics Research Laboratory) (October 2022 - June 2023)
	+ Nancy, France
	+ Addressed fragmentation challenges. Lowered the prediction error by 63% and improved robustness by 70%.
	+ Gathered and preprocessed data using Outlier Management, Gaussian Transformation, Feature Selection, etc.
	+ Stacked fine-tuned regressors (MLP, XGBoost, SVR, ElasticNet).
	+ Estimated uncertainty of Neural Network predictions using Bayesian methods (Monte Carlo Dropout).
