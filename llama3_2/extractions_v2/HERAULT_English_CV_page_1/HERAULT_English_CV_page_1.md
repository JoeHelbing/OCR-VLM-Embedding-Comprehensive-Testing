**Projects**
### Project 1
* Study of the stability of a tank truck according to its shape
* Fluid mechanics and building of what is needed to perform experiments
* Construction of a miniature tank truck that can move at constant acceleration speed
* First experiment with colored fluid which was filmed. Goal: to study the evolution of the bay center according to time and acceleration thanks to image processing on films
* Second experiment to study the pressure forces on the sidewalls of the tank thanks to pressure captors and accelerometers
* Variation of the acceleration to obtain curves representing the movement of the bay center or points
* Numerical fluid simulations to compare the results of pressures, forces and bay center evolution with experiments to find the best shape for the tank
